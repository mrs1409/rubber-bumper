RUBBER BUMPER
 McKinsey | Round 1 | Manufacturing
 Rubber Bumper Co is a small family owned producer of rubber products. It 
prides itself on producing a limited range of products but producing the 
highest quality on the market. In general, new products are introduced after 
much deliberation and careful market study. The company has recently 
appointed a new President who noticed decreasing profits over the last 
couple of years.

 Expected Analysis: There are a number of possible frameworks for this question. A good answer will cover 
all areas you’d expect: industry trends, margins, product mix, competitors, etcwithin reason. Generic 
frameworks are inappropriate.

 Exhibit Guidance:
 The interviewee should notice and verbally acknowledge the following in Exhibit 1. This is where you insert question and the answers to the question
 Question 1: The team decided to look at the product mix and their industry wide positions. The company only has two 
products: rubber bands and condoms. The analysts on our team compiled these two tables. (Display Ex. 1). What does this 
tell you? 
How to Move Forward:
 Expected Insights: 
1.The rubber band market is flat whereas the condom market is showing strong growth in the United States 
2.The dominant player in the rubber band industry is gaining more and more market share 
3.While the condom industry is growing (30% from 2005 to 2011) the major competitors are not growing as fast (~15% each). 
4.The condom industry is more fragmented than the rubber band industry, and the smaller players are getting a larger proportion of the market
 Commentary: 
The candidate should ultimately start to see that the rubber band industry is becoming less attractive and the condom 
industry is showing growth and the major market players are not keeping up with the growth. A great response will 
automatically want to see why Rubber Bumper’s condom growth has tapered off while the industry keeps expanding. If they 
do not get to that issue, prod them until they do.

 Question 2: Rubber Bumper Co has two factories, each producing one of their two products. They essentially do not share 
any fixed costs and for the most part are run as separate P&L’s. The team would like you to put together a quick summary 
and compare the financial profitability of each of the two factories for the most recent year. 
Rubber Band Factory 
• They make boxes of 500 rubber bands that they sell to retailers for $20 a box 
• 1 pound of rubber makes approximately 125 rubber bands 
• They should already have the amount of rubber they used from the exhibit 
• The rubber band factory has an inclusive $4MM in annual overhead 
• [ONLY PROVIDE WHEN ASKED] It costs $1 to turn a pound of rubber into a pound of rubber bands (assume no 
waste) 
Condom Factory 
• They sell 4 packs of condoms to retailers for $3 a pack 
• They factory is smaller than the rubber band factory and only costs $2 MM in annual overhead, inclusive of everything 
• [ONLY PROVIDE WHEN ASKED] Each condom costs $0.10 to make

12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER
 Expected Calculations: (Question 2) 
Students may get tripped up because one starts with the number of condoms, and the other starts with the amount of pure 
rubber and need to infer the number of bands sold. (rb = rubber band): 
• 2MM lbs of rubber x 125rb’s/lb = 250 MM rb’s
 • 250MM rb’s / 500 rbs/box = 500K boxes x $20 box = $10MM in Revenue 
• 2MM lbs of rubber x $1 = $2MM in variable costs 
• RB Profit = $10 - $2 - $4 = $4MM in profit 
• 10 MM condoms / 4 pack = 2.5 MM packs x $3 = $7.5MM in Revenue 
• 10MM condoms x $0.10 = $1MM in variable costs 
• Condom Profit = 7.5 – 1 – 2 = 4.5MM in profit 
Commentary: A good answer will arrive at the math and note that the two profits are fairly comparable. A great answer will 
also note that the margin on the condoms is significantly higher (4.5 MM in profit for 3 MM in costs, rather than 4MM in 
profit for 6 MM in costs). Also, a great answer will question why the overhead for the condom factory is small compared with 
the rubber band.

12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER
 Question 3: It turns out that the two overhead figures are significantly different because the capacity of the second factory 
is much smaller, about half as much. The President has asked us to evaluate whether we should switch production of the 
first plant to make more condoms since we have reached capacity at the smaller plant (assume a factory can only make 1 
thing). 
Supplementary Information
 Give out the following information ONLY WHEN REQUESTED. 
• It will cost $2MM dollars to refurbish the new plant and take 1 year to complete during which time the factory will be off 
line. (If asked, assume there are no tax benefits from depreciating the CapEx and no cost of capital) 
• Overhead would remain the same 
• During this time, we won’t be able to make any rubber bands 
• The bigger plant can produce twice the volume of condoms as the smaller plant. 
• Rubber Bumper Co’s payback period for such projects is 4 years. 
• Assume that Rubber Bumpers rubber band demand has stabilized at 2MM lbs per year.

12 | CASE: RUBBER BUMPER
 Expected Calculations: (Question 3) 
A bad answer will simply look at 4.5MM in profit and 4.0MM and say that Rubber Bumper should make more condoms. A 
great answer will look into the costs, the opportunity costs, and the payback period to evaluate whether this should go 
forward. Also a great interviewee will recognize the timing of the payments, and while we don’t have a cost of capital there 
is a timeline such investments must prove profitable. 
• 1 year offline they are losing (10MM – 2MM ) = $8MM in contribution 
• Capital Expenditures = $2MM 
• Total Cost of Project = 8 + 2 = $10MM 
Note we assume that overhead will be paid while the factory is offline, but it should not count as an additional cost, since we would pay that 
anyways. 
• The benefit is the difference in profitability between the two products. 
• The bigger factory can produce twice as many condoms; 6.5MM x 2 = 13MM 
• The bigger factory is currently producing 8MM in contribution (because we are looking for the difference, the $4MM of overhead is a 
wash) 
• Switching will create an additional $13 – 8 = 5MM in profit. 
• The interviewee should draw a conclusion towards the end noting that under these assumptions the project will repay itself in year 3 (1 
year offline + 2 years of operation) and that it is within the required time frame. Additional second level insights are encouraged.

 BRAINSTORM
 What are some of the risks involved with this project? 
Brainstorming Guidance
 This is a “what else” section. Below are some basics but ideally you’re looking for the interviewee to be as creative as 
possible. As with most questions of this type, a bad answer will stop at one or two. A good answer will have a creative list. A 
great answer will have a structure that makes the answer MECE. A great answer should also prioritize the findings indicating 
which ones he thinks are the most important. 
Key Points to Consider
 • Assumes that Rubber Bumper can sell 3x the number of condoms it sells today, immediately. 
• Assumes that rubber band demand wont rebound. The bigger plant is equally profitable because it is being underutilized 
• Political parties could kill sex ed. 
• Less diversification in products exposes them to increased market risk 
• Condoms are not as generic of a product as rubber bands and may require a larger investment in advertising to compete on a higher level 
• Potentially more legal risk in selling contraception than rubber bands 
• Employees may not want to make condoms.

 CONCLUSION
 The President is walking in the board room and expects a summary. Please summarize your findings.
 Expected Analysis 
The summary should start with a recommendation. “You should convert the plant” and then back track into the 
reasoning: industry trends and financial justification. Finally it should mention which of the risks are the most 
problematic and how he would mitigate it. The interviewer should feel free to challenge any part of the 
conclusion and expect a well worded response.
